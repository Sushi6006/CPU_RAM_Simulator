#CS
I use Shortest-Job-First (SJF/SPN) for CS, which runs the shortest job arrived first. SJF/SPN is better than FCFS because by matching job-time with waiting-time, the turnaround time is reduced; otherwise, if long processes are before short processes, those short processes will have large overheads. SJF also finishes processes one by one, which results shorter average turnaround time for processes at the end of the queue than Round-Robin. Also, for RR, if quantum is small, switching between processes constantly would take much resources; while if the quantum is large it's basically FCFS which is less effictive than SPN.

#CM
I use Virtual-Memory for CM, but evict the most recently used pages. In RR, all processses are ran one by one in a loop, removing the least recently used pages may cause longer load time. Therefore, evicting the most recent processess may reduce the load time, turnaround time and time overhead and, therefore, a better performance overall.
